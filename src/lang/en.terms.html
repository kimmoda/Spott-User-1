  <li class='list__heading'>Services</li>
  <p>SPOTT offers the SPOTT User the ability to consult information in an interactive manner relating to particular films, series, television programmes, television personalities and advertisement during or as a result of watching television. This information is extracted by Appiness by means of visual algorithms. The SPOTT User can view, flick through and, if desired, purchase related products and services online via SPOTT-linked websites of third parties. In addition, the SPOTT User can subscribe to content, actors or brands. On the basis of these subscriptions, the SPOTT User will be presented with an adjusted feed. This feed can show promotions which are based on the preferences of the SPOTT User. These services (the “Services”) are offered by Appiness to the SPOTT User via SPOTT.</p>

  <li class='list__heading'>Liability</li>
  <ol>
    <li>SPOTT has been compiled with the greatest possible care. However, Appiness cannot guarantee that SPOTT and the information acquired via SPOTT is error free, accurate or complete.</li>
    <li>Appiness is in any event not liable for:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>any damage to or change in the equipment of the SPOTT User, including (but not limited to) the mobile device as a result of the installation, upgrade, update or use of SPOTT;</li>
        <li>the temporary unavailability, suspension, interruption or delay of all or certain Services of SPOTT;</li>
        <li>any loss as a result of any difficulty or inability to download or gain access to SPOTT content or as a result of any other telecommunication system error which leads to SPOTT not being available;</li>
        <li>any loss as a result of the unavailability of the Applications of Third Parties integrated in SPOTT as referred to in article 5, or as a result of the incorrectness, incompleteness or the inaccuracy of the information provided by third parties, nor can such external information give rise to any obligation on the part of Appiness;</li>
        <li>any direct or indirect loss as a result of, or relating to, the (poor) operation of the mobile device of the SPOTT User or of the telecommunication services or software or hardware of a third party;</li>
        <li>any indirect loss, including loss of profit, direct trading loss, loss of credit balances, loss of clients, loss of a chance to purchase a product or service via SPOTT (whether or not for a specific price), loss of contracts, loss of goodwill, loss of data, claims of third parties, or any consequential loss or indirect loss or losses irrespective of whether or not they were contractual, non-contractual, foreseeable, known, foreseen or of any other nature.</li>
      </ol>
    <li>The provisions of this article do not limit Appiness’s liability for its own intentional error or fraud.</li>
  </ol>

  <li class='list__heading'>Applications of Third Parties</li>
  <ol>
    <li>SPOTT integrates applications, linked websites and services of third parties to make information, content, advertising, products and/or services available to the SPOTT User (“Applications of Third Parties”).</li>
    <li>Appiness does not exercise any form of control over the Applications of Third Parties and therefore does not give any guarantees relating to the information which is provided via the Applications of Third Parties. From the moment the SPOTT User consults or uses Applications of Third Parties, the SPOTT User is no longer in the SPOTT environment and Appiness does not give any guarantees nor bear any responsibility or liability, regardless of the transaction which were to take place between the SPOTT User and the third party. Appiness rejects all liability for any loss which could be caused to the SPOTT User by the consultation or use of Applications of Third Parties, whatever the nature, extent, cause or the consequences of this loss might be.</li>
    <li>SPOTT may state prices for certain products or services which are offered via Applications of Third Parties. These prices are purely indicative and do not form a binding offer by Appiness, as Appiness only reflects prices of third parties. It is the exclusive responsibility of the SPOTT User to verify whether the prices indicated in SPOTT correspond with the prices which are charged by third parties. Appiness does not bear any liability if it were to appear that the indicated prices do not correspond with the prices charged by the relevant third parties and the stated prices cannot give rise to any obligation by Appiness towards the SPOTT User or third parties.</li>
    <li>SPOTT may state information (sizes, availability, characteristics for example) in respect of certain products or services which are offered via Applications of Third Parties. Appiness does not bear any liability if it were to appear that this information does not correspond with reality nor does this give rise to any obligation by Appiness towards the SPOTT User or third parties.</li>
    <li>The consultation of, or use by, the SPOTT User of Applications of Third Parties may possibly be governed by separate general terms and conditions, a separate privacy policy and other agreements with third parties. Appiness advises the SPOTT User to read these documents carefully in order to understand how these parties collect and Process Personal Data. The only action the SPOTT User may take towards Appiness in respect of whatever problem or dissatisfaction with Applications of Third Parties or their content is to uninstall SPOTT from his mobile device or to cease the use of such Applications of Third Parties.</li>
  </ol>

  <li class='list__heading'>User Content</li>
  <ol>
    <li>The SPOTT User acknowledges that he has the right to post User Content and that such User Content, or the use of such by Appiness, does not constitute a breach of any agreement, legislation or intellectual property rights or any other rights of third parties.</li>
    <li>Appiness can always check, verify, adjust, block or remove User Content but is under no obligation to do so. The SPOTT User is solely responsible for the posted User Content and Appiness cannot be held responsible for this in any way.</li>
    <li>When the SPOTT User gives feedback to Appiness, he acknowledges that this feedback is not confidential. The SPOTT User gives Appiness the right to use this feedback without any restrictions and without payment and to pass it on to third parties.</li>
    <li>The SPOTT User grants Appiness a continuous, non-exclusive, transferable, free and irrevocable licence to use the User Content either wholly or in part or to reproduce, make it available to the public, publish, translate, change, make derived works from and share it in any medium.</li>
  </ol>

    <li>All copyrights, database rights and software rights vested in all material included in, on, or available via SPOTT, including all information, data, text, music, sound, photos, graphics and video messages and all source codes, software compilations and other materials, are the exclusive property of Appiness or its licensors.</li>

  <ol>
    <li>Appiness guarantees that it shall act to the best of its ability when making SPOTT available to the SPOTT User.

SPOTT is available via the mobile device of the SPOTT User if it is within the range of a wireless network. The quality of SPOTT may vary in accordance with the mobile device.</li>
    <li>Appiness however reserves the right, at any moment and from time to time, to temporarily interrupt, limit, change or stop SPOTT (or any part of it) if this is required for technical reasons, maintenance or updates.</li>
    <li>Appiness cannot guarantee that the software used in, or given in licence in connection with, SPOTT is compatible with any software of third parties.

  </ol>

  </ol>

  <li class='list__heading'>Privacy</li>
